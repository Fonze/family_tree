# FAMILY TREE

_Was done in January 2018_

This app was created as an assignment for a potential job. The app requests family tree data from an
URI and visualizes it for the user. The user has to input a valid family member to the app's
suggesting search field and after submitting the app searches for the family member's parents,
grandparents, siblings, significant other and children.

The app can be tested by installing the family-tree.apk to an Android device with version 6.0 or newer.
